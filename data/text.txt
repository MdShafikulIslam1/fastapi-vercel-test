The Story of 21st February:
Is a Language Worth Dying For?. The History of February 21 as ...
In 1952, the newly formed nation of Pakistan, which included East Bengal (later Bangladesh), faced a linguistic crisis. The Pakistani government, primarily composed of West Pakistanis, declared Urdu as the sole state language, despite a majority of East Pakistanis speaking Bengali. This decision sparked widespread protests and unrest in East Bengal, with students at the forefront of the movement. 
On February 21, 1952, students defied a ban on public gatherings (Section 144) and marched towards the provincial assembly to protest the language policy. The police responded with force, opening fire on the unarmed protestors. Several students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat, and Abdul Jabbar, were killed. These martyrs became symbols of the struggle for Bengali language rights. 
The killings sparked further outrage and civil unrest across East Bengal. The movement continued, and eventually, the Pakistani government was forced to recognize Bengali as one of the state languages in 1956. The sacrifices of the language martyrs played a crucial role in shaping Bengali national identity and paving the way for the eventual liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.
